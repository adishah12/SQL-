SQL Lesson 13: Inserting rows
===================================
INSERT INTO mytable
(column, another_column, …)
VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
      (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
      …;
	  
Exercise 13 — Tasks
1.Add the studio's new production, Toy Story 4 to the list of movies (you can use any director)
ANS = Insert into movies values (12, "Toy Story 4", "Aadi Shah", 1995, 90);
2.Toy Story 4 has been released to critical acclaim! It had a rating of 8.7, and 
made 340 million domestically and 270 million internationally. Add the record to the BoxOffice table.
ANS =INSERT INTO boxoffice VALUES (4, 8.7, 340000000, 270000000);

SQL Lesson 14: Updating rows
=====================================
UPDATE mytable
	SET column = value_or_expr, 
    other_column = another_value_or_expr, 
    …
WHERE condition;

Exercise 14 — Tasks
1.The director for A Bug's Life is incorrect, it was actually directed by John Lasseter
ANS = UPDATE movies SET director = "John Lasseter" WHERE title = "A Bug's Life";
2.The year that Toy Story 2 was released is incorrect, it was actually released in 1999
ANS = UPDATE movies SET year = 1999 WHERE id = 3;
3.Both the title and director for Toy Story 8 is incorrect! The title should be "Toy Story 3" and it was directed by Lee Unkrich
ANS = UPDATE movies SET title = "Toy Story 3", director = "Lee Unkrich" where id = 11 ;

SQL Lesson 15: Deleting rows
===============================
	DELETE FROM mytable
	WHERE condition;

Exercise 15 — Tasks
1.This database is getting too big, lets remove all movies that were released before 2005.
ANS = DELETE FROM movies where year < 2005;
2.Andrew Stanton has also left the studio, so please remove all movies directed by him.
ANS = Delete from movies where director ="Andrew Stanton";

SQL Lesson 16: Creating tables
---------------------------------------
		CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (
    column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    another_column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    … );

Exercise 16 — Tasks
Q Create a new table named Database with the following columns:
– Name A string (text) describing the name of the database
– Version A number (floating point) of the latest version of this database
– Download_count An integer count of the number of times this database was downloaded
This table has no constraints.
ANS = CREATE TABLE if not exists Database (
    Name TEXT,
    Version FLOAT,
    Download_count INTEGER);

SQL Lesson 17: Altering tables
-------------------------------------
		ALTER TABLE mytable
		ADD/DROP/RENAME/MODIFY column DataType OptionalTableConstraint 
		DEFAULT default_value;

Exercise 17 — Tasks
1.Add a column named Aspect_ratio with a FLOAT data type to store the aspect-ratio each movie was released in.
ANS = ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN Aspect_ratio FLOAT DEFAULT 3.0;
2.Add another column named Language with a TEXT data type to store the language that the movie was released in. 
Ensure that the default for this language is English.
ANS = ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN Language text Default English;

SQL Lesson 18: Dropping tables
------------------------------------
Exercise 18 — Tasks
1.We've sadly reached the end of our lessons, lets clean up by removing the Movies table
ANS = DROP TABLE movies;
2.And drop the BoxOffice table as well
ANS = DROP TABLE Boxoffice ;
